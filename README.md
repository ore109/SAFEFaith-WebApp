**SAFEFaith**
AI-assisted, faith-centered safety and community resilience platform

**Product Vision**
To empower Christian communities—starting in Nigeria—with timely safety alerts, trusted community coordination, preparedness guidance, and faith-based support during periods of insecurity.
_Slogan_:
Faith that strengthens safety — not replacing safety with faith.

**Problem Statement**
Christians living in high-risk or underserved regions often lack:
1. Timely and reliable safety information
2. A trusted, community-specific alert system
3. Clear guidance on what actions to take during security threats
4. Emotional and spiritual support during and after crises

In many Nigerian communities, limited access to fast and reliable medical care increases panic, confusion, and vulnerability during emergencies. These gaps reduce preparedness and increase harm during security incidents.

Value Proposition
1. SAFEFaith helps Christian communities:
2. Receive early, location-aware safety alerts
3. Coordinate safely within trusted church and community networks
4. Access clear, actionable safety guidance before and during emergencies
5. Build emotional and spiritual resilience through faith-based support

The platform focuses on prevention, preparedness, and community response, especially in environments where formal emergency and medical services may be limited or delayed.
